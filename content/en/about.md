## Our Mission

The Sovereign Tech Directory is a community-driven project that helps organisations and individuals find software aligned with European digital sovereignty goals. We provide clear, verifiable information about tools and services without tracking, advertising, or hidden agendas.

## Our Principles

All tool data is stored in version-controlled YAML files and every evaluation criterion is documented. This site does not use cookies or third-party tracking. Anyone can suggest additions or corrections via pull request, and all changes are publicly reviewable.
